I am very excited and I want to use this opportunity to practice my learnings in Coursera in order to answer relevant questions arisen.\nThe key question is :  How can I find a convenient and enjoyable place similar to mine now in singapore?\nCertainly, I can use available real estate apps and Google but the idea is to use and apply myself the learned tools during the course.\nIn order to make a comparison and evaluation of the rental options in Manhattan NY, I must set some basis, therefore the apartment in Manhattan must meet the following demands:\n - apartment must be 2 or 3 bedrooms\n - desired location is near a metro station in the Manhattan area and within 1.0 mile (1.6 km) radius\n - price of rent not exceed $7,000 per month\n - top ammenities in the selected neighborhood shall be similar to current residence\n - desirable to have venues such as coffee shops, restaurants Asian Thai, wine stores, gym and food shops\n - as a reference, I have included a map of venues near current residence in Singapore.\n    ",

The data required to resolve this challenge is described in the following section 2, below.\n\n\n### Interested Audience\nI believe this is a relevant challenge with valid questions for anyone moving to other large city in US, EU or Asia. The same methodology can be applied in accordance to demands as applicable. This case is also applicable for anyone interested in exploring starting or locating a new business in any city. Lastly, it can also serve as a good practical exercise to develop Data Science skills.\n",

I will be able to quickly point to the popups to know the relative price per subway area.\n- Addresses from rental locations will be converted to geodata( lat, long) using Geopy-distance and Nominatim.\n- Data will be searched in open data sources if available, from real estate sites if open to reading, libraries or other government agencies such as Metro New York MTA, etc.\n\n\nThe procesing of these DATA will allow to answer the key questions to make a decision:\n- what is the cost of rent (per square ft) around a mile radius from each subway metro station?\n- what is the area of Manhattan with best rental pricing that meets criteria established?\n- What is the distance from work place ( Park Ave and 53 rd St) and the tentative future home?\n- What are the venues of the two best places to live? How the prices compare?\n- How venues distribute among Manhattan neighborhoods and around metro stations?\n- Are there tradeoffs between size and price and location?\n- Any other interesting statistical data findings of the real estate and overall data.\n\n",
